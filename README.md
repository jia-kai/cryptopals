# cryptopals

My solutions to [the cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) in
python3.

Run `./main.py` to run all solutions; run `./main.py -h` to see available
options.

Dependencies: `numpy`, `gmpy2`, `cryptography`

Note: I've skipped some challenges that are boring to me; they would just
return "skipped". The reasons for them being boring are documented in the
source.
